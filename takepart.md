# How do I take part?

Interested? Cool! Read on.

## How much does it cost?

To cover the cost of making the medal and posting it to you it will cost you around Â£4 (yet to be finalised), with **no profit** for anyone.

## How do I sign up?

Drop an email to **signmeup@palindromeday.co.uk** or let us know you intend to take part.

## What do I do on the day?

Easy, on 2nd December 2021, log some exercise in a way that can be evidenced.

You can run, cycle, walk, row, do the samba, whatever, as long as it's in a **COVID-safe way**.

You can do practically anything that involves moving yourself over a distance. You don't have to go outside to do this either, it's meant to be an inclusive event.

## How do I get my medal?

Simple, send some evidence that you covered some distance on the day to **finished@palindromeday.co.uk**. You can do this by sending a:

- screen shot of your Strava activity
- picture of your fitness watch
- anything that proves you covered some distance.

Assuming your evidence passes our highly stringent examination you will get a response requesting a postal address and letting you know how to pay for your medal.

You get extra kudos if the distance submitted is a palindrome, for example 5,005m!

Note, kudos won't actually be included with the medal, we don't have any actual kudos, but they will be present in spirit.
