# What's this event then?

Be active on Palindrome Day this year and earn a unique Palindrome-themed medal!

## 12th of February 2021 is Palindrome Day!
Well, I think I might have invented that and it doesn't exist, so what am I talking about?

A palindrome is a series of numbers or letters that reads the same from right to left as it does from left to right, e.g. racecar.

Palindrome dates in the UK are pretty rare because of the date format we use. In fact until recently the last palindrome date we had was on the 11th of November in the year 1111!

Last year a cool thing happened, on the 2nd of Feb we had our first palindrome date in over 900 years - 02.02.2020.

This year we have a second palindrome date: 12.02.2021.

To celebrate this momentous occurrence we are holding a virtual Palindrome Day event. Run, Cycle, Walk, cover a distance, and you can earn an exclusive Palindrome-themed medal!

## Why are you doing this event?

Well, we love palindromes.

The other reason is that we believe exercise is good for our mental wellbeing, and this last year or so has been pretty rubbish for people all over the world everywhere. It has often been difficult or impossible to exercise, so just when we need it, we can't do it. Once we get out of an exercise routine it is often hard to get back on it. Motivation has been in short supply for lots of people.

So, this event is a celebration of a palindrome date, or it is a thinly veiled excuse to do some exercise to earn a medal.

# How do I take part?

Interested? Cool! Read on.

## How much does it cost?

To cover the cost of making the medal and posting it to you it will cost you around Â£4 (yet to be finalised), with **no profit** for anyone.

## How do I sign up?

Drop an email to **signmeup@palindromeday.co.uk** or let us know you intend to take part.

## What do I do on the day?

Easy, on February 12th 2021, log some exercise in a way that can be evidenced.

You can run, cycle, walk, row, do the samba, whatever, as long as it's in a **COVID-safe way**.

You can do practically anything that involves moving yourself over a distance. You don't have to go outside to do this either, it's meant to be an inclusive event.

## How do I get my medal?

Simple, send some evidence that you covered some distance on 12th Feb to **finished@palindromeday.co.uk**. You can do this by sending a:

- screen shot of your strava activity
- picture of your fitness watch
- anything that proves you covered some distance.

Assuming your evidence passes our highly stringent examination you will get a response requesting a postal address and letting you know how to pay for your medal.

You get extra kudos if the distance submitted is a palindrome, for example 5,005m!

Note, kudos won't actually be included with the medal, we don't have any actual kudos, but they will be present in spirit.

# Anything else?

We are grateful you read this far down! A few more details!

## Tell me about the medal

Oh, it's beautiful. Exclusively designed by me and I am highly unqualified to design anything.

![A picture of the medal](medal.JPG)

Each one is hand made. Seriously! I will be 3D printing them and then hand sewing the ribbon on.

They are 60mm wide x 100mm tall and made from the finest Polylactic Acid (PLA, a plastic, I don't own a metal printer). They are attached to 80cm of 38mm wide red satin ribbon.

It's inspired by the Sator Square, a two dimensional, five word Latin palindrome with four symmetries.

## How many people are taking part?

Oh this is an exclusive event, highly exclusive. In fact, apart from me I think one other person may participate. Between you and me though I think they might be humouring me...

## Who's the we you keep talking about?

Well, to be honest there's only me. Perhaps lockdown has sent me a little strange...

## Where can I get more information?

Good question. Send an email to **info@palindromeday.co.uk**.

## Is this the worst website on the internet?

Probably.
