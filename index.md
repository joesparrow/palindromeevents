# What's this event then?

Be active on Palindrome Day this year and earn a unique Palindrome-themed medal!

## 12th of February 2021 is Palindrome Day!
Well, I think I might have invented that and it doesn't exist, so what am I talking about?

A palindrome is a series of numbers or letters that reads the same from right to left as it does from left to right, e.g. racecar.

Palindrome dates in the UK are pretty rare because of the date format we use. In fact until recently the last palindrome date we had was on the 11th of November in the year 1111!

Last year a cool thing happened, on the 2nd of Feb we had our first palindrome date in over 900 years - 02.02.2020.

This year we have a second palindrome date: 12.02.2021.

To celebrate this monumentous occurrence we are holding a virtual Palindrome Day event. Run, Cycle, Walk, cover a distance, and you can earn an exclusive Palindrome-themed medal!

## Why are you doing this event?

Well, we love palindromes.

The other reason is that we believe exercise is good for our mental wellbeing, and this last year or so has been pretty rubbish for people all over the world everywhere. It has often been difficult or impossible to exercise, so just when we need it, we can't do it. Once we get out of an exercise routine it is often hard to get back on it. Motivation has been in short supply for lots of people.

So, this event is a celebration of a palindrome date, or it is a thinly veiled excuse to do some exercise to earn a medal.

# How do I take part?

Interested? Cool! Read on.

## How much does it cost?

To cover the cost of making the medal and posting it to you it will cost you around Â£4 (yet to be finalised), with **no profit** for anyone.

## What do I do?

Easy, on February 12th 2021, log some exercise in a way that can be evidenced.

You can run, cycle, walk, row, do the samba, whatever, as long as it's in a **COVID-safe way**.

You can do practically anything that involves moving yourself over a distance. You don't have to go outside to do this either, it's meant to be an inclusive event.

## How do I get my medal?

Simple, send us some money and some evidence that you covered some distance (probably by email, working on that) on 12th Feb. You can do this by sending a:

- screen shot of your strava activity
- picture of your fitness watch
- anything that proves you covered some distance.

You get extra kudos if the distance is a palindrome, for example 5,005m!

Note, kudos won't actually be included with the medal, I don't have any actual kudos, but they will be present in spirit.

# Anything else?

We are grateful you read this far down! A few more details!

## Tell me about the medal

Oh, it's beautiful. Exclusively designed by me and I am high unqualified to design anything.

Each one is hand made. Seriously! I will be 3D printing them and then hand sewing the ribbon on.

It's inspired by the Sator Square, a five word latin palindrome.

## How many people are taking part?

Oh this is an exclusive event, highly exclusive. In fact, apart from me I think one other person may participate. Between you and me though I think they might be humouring me...

## Who's the we you keep talking about?

Well, to be honest there's only me. Perhaps lockdown has sent me a little strange...

## Where can I get more information?

Good question. Email address to follow.

## Is this the worst website on the internet?

Probably.
